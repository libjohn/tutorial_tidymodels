## R Markdown documents for RStudio Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è to accompany tidymodels articles

This repository contains R Markdown documents to accompany the five [Get Started](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) articles.

You can open the R Markdown files by clicking on the file name in the Files pane on the right. üëâ

1. Build a model: `01_build_a_model.Rmd`
2. Preprocess your data with recipes: `02_preprocess_with_recipes.Rmd`  
3. Evaluate your model with resampling: `03_evaluate_with_resampling.Rmd`
4. Tune model parameters: `04_tune_model_parameters .Rmd`
5. A predictive modeling case study: `05_case_study.Rmd`

These R Markdown documents are here to help you walk through the articles by running identical code chunks. 
Feel free to change the code, and explore the tidymodels functions and objects.
If you would like to keep the changes you've made, don't forget to click on "save a permanent copy" on top right!
